Image Classification with ANN and CNN
This project demonstrates the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification. The goal is to compare the performance of ANN and CNN on the same dataset.

Introduction
In this project, we explore the differences in performance between an ANN and a CNN when applied to an image classification task. CNNs are specifically designed to handle image data and are expected to perform better due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies and local patterns.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of images with dimensions 32x32 and 3 color channels (RGB). Ensure that your dataset is appropriately preprocessed and divided into training and testing sets.

Results
ANN Accuracy: 49% after 5 epochs
CNN Accuracy: 79% after 10 epochs
The CNN significantly outperforms the ANN, demonstrating the effectiveness of convolutional layers in extracting meaningful features from image data.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the superior performance of CNNs over ANNs for image classification tasks. By leveraging convolutional layers, CNNs can effectively capture spatial hierarchies and local patterns, leading to higher accuracy and better generalization.
